          <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
          <p>
            Arkane studios' website exemplifies hicks law. Their page is layed
            out simply and doesn't present more than one set of options to the
            user at once. As you scroll down, you see the work for us page,
            starting first with the two work locations. If you're interested,
            you might choose the one you live closest too and go from there.

          <h3>White Space</h3>
          <p>
            Bethesda shows off great white space design. They give each game
            studio they advocate for space to breath and exist on the page. When
            you land there, it's all you see aside from the title and nav bar.
            It puts all the focus on these 6 items and gives you space to breath
            too.

          <h3>Visual heirarchy</h3>
          <p>
            Xbox's landing page is emblematic of good visual heirarchy. If I
            visit the xbox website, I see their rotating hero image first which
            is perhaps an ad for something I might be interested in(and the
            associated call to action button if I am), then I see what I came
            for which is probably to buy or look at something i might buy. Each
            of the 6 options for action has equal weight at the bottom of the
            page. It's easy to sort out visually what someone might be there to
            do or want on the page and what is most important.
